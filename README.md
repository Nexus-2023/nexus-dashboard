## Introduction

Welcome to Nexus Network, a groundbreaking solution that empowers Layer 2 blockchains with an efficient staking mechanism for ETH locked in bridge contracts of rollups. Built using Solidity, TypeScript, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, Rainbow Kit Wallet, Ethers.js, Anime.js, and the Graph Protocol, Nexus Network revolutionizes the world of blockchain technology. Our goal is to bring capital efficiency to Layer 2 rollups without the complexity of validator operations.

## Key Features

### Plug n Play Staking Infrastructure
Nexus Network offers a seamless setup of staking infrastructure with minimal modifications to bridge contracts. Within minutes, you can have a robust staking mechanism up and running.

### Custom Staking Limits
Rollup projects can tailor their staking experience by choosing the amount of ETH to be staked, ranging from 0% to 100%. This flexibility ensures that the staking mechanism aligns with specific project requirements.

### Hassle-Free Validator Operations
We handle end-to-end validator operations. Our solution leverages Distributed Validator Technology for enhanced security, ensuring the utmost reliability in your staking infrastructure. We're also proud to collaborate with Ethereum's leading decentralized ETH staking platform.

### Proud Recipients of Grant from SSV Network
Nexus Network is honored to be a recipient of a grant from the SSV Network, further validating the importance and innovation behind our project.

## Overview

In this demo, we showcase the staking of ETH natively on a Layer 2 blockchain like Optimism. This significantly boosts the capital efficiency of ETH locked in Layer 1 bridge contracts. The native token of the Layer 2 blockchain serves as a liquid staking token, representing the staked ETH on the Layer 1 side.

We achieve this by modifying the Optimism Layer 1 bridge contract, running our custom Optimism node, utilizing [ssv.network](https://ssv.network/) for ETH staking, and implementing a user-friendly frontend built with TypeScript and React for staking operations.
